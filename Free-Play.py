IT flagged a workstation during an asset audit and found that someone from Procurement
had installed some game from 2009 on his corporate laptop. Apparently, he was obsessed with
the game and had been "working from home" for three weeks, seemingly just staring at his character roster
HR wants to know what he was doing and luckily recovered his save file along with a screenshot from the backup share
Go figure out what is so special about this save file

Flag format: The flag is found as a string with underscores, wrap the text in brunner{<text>}
Example: if you found the flag text_here, the flag to submit would be brunner{text_here}

Note: This challenge is fully solvable from the handout. Please do not attempt to obtain a game copy illegally!

    A small utility that reads raw binary offsets from a SaveGame file,
    mapping null/byte values (0x00 and 0x03) into binary bitstreams (0 and 1) to
    recover hidden memory structures
