Magic or not
Difficulty: Easy

As an intern at Brunner Corporation, I developed a cutting-edge image obfuscation algorithm, designed
to hide sensitive image data. I'm confident it's secure, but
the security team isn't convinced, they believe custom cryptography always hides a flaw

Can you prove them wrong? Analyze the implementation, recover the original image, and find the flag
