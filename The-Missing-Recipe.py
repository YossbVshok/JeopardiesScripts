The Missing Recipe
Difficulty: Medium

Brunner Corporation's research department has discovered that some inappropriate Brunner
images and a confidential internal recipe have disappeared from the network

No one knows exactly when or how it happened, but several employees reported unusual
network activity around the time of the incident

Fortunately, Brunner Corporation's Security Operations Center (SOC) has a full network
capture (PCAP) from the period. However, the analysts have been unable to determine what really happened

Can you reconstruct the attack and recover the flag?
Please do not look at the pictures
